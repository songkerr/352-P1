                <p>Proposal <br>_ is a dog walking app that combines dog walking tracks and socialization.<br> The app allows users to register their dog and create profiles with their dog’s stats. Dogs can be categorised under small, medium or large breeds, and active or chill to receive catered track suggestions. <br> Users can search up locations, discover what tracks or dog parks are nearby, and may optionally use a map to guide their journey. <br> Users can rate tracks and dog parks, and post comments on each for others to see. <br>The social aspect of _ allows for users to search dog breeds or level of activity, and connect with others who may have a dog with the same criteria. They can then message individuals or groups to plan dog walks/meetings. <br> _ is the perfect app for discovering new walking tracks suited to your dog, and for meeting other dog lovers. <br><br>Visual Direction <br>_ will incorporate a green/blue colour palette. Because there are so many aspects to the app, design will be kept minimal – to not over-clutter the screen.
